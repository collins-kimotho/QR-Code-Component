### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
<div class="container">
  <div class="card">
    <img src="images/image-qr-code.png" alt="" />
    <div class="text">.....</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
body {
  font-family: "Outfit", sans-serif;
  background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
  min-height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  font-size: 15px;
}
```

### Continued development

- To further improve my skills, i would like to improve on my styling, specifically using css without the use of libraries and frameworks.
- Build more static websites that are well styled and visually pleasing.

### Useful resources

- [Mr Coder Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BBYPntB-GY&ab_channel=MrCoder) - Mr Coder helped me with understanding styling using css. I really liked his video on the challenge. Easy to understand and straight to the point.
